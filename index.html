        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Pre-BusinessðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">    Hey, Iâ€™m Ivy. I am a freshman student in the pre-business program at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 18 years ago, I was born in Monterey Park. Soon after, my family moved to a little city called Hacienda Heights. However, when I was barely one, my parents sent me to live with my grandparents in Fujian, China. My days there were quite a blur. Until this day, I cannot recall anything about my experience there. Though, Iâ€™ve only recently found out that I was sent there because my parents were too busy raising two kids and starting up their own company that they had to send me away, since my sister was older and easier to take care of. After a year in China, I came back  to America. Luckily, my parents worked extremely hard and were able to provide for my sister and I. Although we were definitely not well-off, they made life comfortable and enjoyable. My parents were fortunate to be able to create their own successful companies and life after has passed in a flash. <br><br>

              In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, playing sports, and exploring new food spots. Additionally, I love all things computers. Because of my love for computers, itâ€™s only natural that I took a liking to computer science. I took a computer science class in high school and I want to continue pursuing it in college, hence why I want to concentrate in Information Systems. You may ask why I am not just majoring in computer science. Well, itâ€™s because I also love MONEY! Itâ€™s fascinating to me how money works and how it flows throughout our lives and in our economy. I want to be able to start my own business one day, or possibly take over one of my parentâ€™s businesses, so learning about business is crucial.  <br><br>

              Currently, I have no professional experience in business, however, throughout  my adolescent years, Iâ€™ve always had a knack for selling things. Whether it be food or homemade bracelets or homemade paper toys,, Iâ€™ve always tried to make money. To add on,  Iâ€™ve worked as a basketball stats keeper and in an afterschool program for kids as a teacher. In both these jobs, Iâ€™ve had to deal with a variety of people of all different ages and backgrounds. Taking these experiences, I want to rush in the professional business frat, Alpha Kappa Psi.  Although Iâ€™m quite  independent and introverted, I must overcome my social anxiety if I want to accomplish my goals.  <br><br>
        
              In the next few years I am hoping to travel to China where my Dadâ€™s company is based and spend a few weeks as an average employee, getting a hindsight about how businesses work differently and similarly in China as compared to the United States. Next, I am hoping to intern and eventually land a job at Riot Games, the company that created my favorite games to expand my business knowledge and experiences. Afterwards, I will take my newfound wisdom and begin pursuing my own business or take over my parentâ€™s businesses, letting them peacefully retire. Truthfully,  Iâ€™m not sure where life will take me, but I know my hardwork and determination will conquer it all.
